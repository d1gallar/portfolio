      <br> UI/UX Design Project - 10 Weeks</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p> In our UCSD Interaction Design course, I worked with 4 other team members to
      either extend or redesign a feature of a widely used mobile app. After
      working on this project for 10 weeks, our team had to incorporate design
      principles and learned about how users interact with a product, conducted
      user testing to improve our designs, and learned about usability
      and information architecture.</p>
    <br>

    <p> Our team focused on extending the Spotify app and aimed at helping music
      enthusiasts find new ways to find friends or concert buddies that share
      similar music tastes. While working on this project, I helped on
      conducting user interviews for user feedback, experimented with different
      types of prototypes, and designed the user interface of the app.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="projectTabText">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>We all currently have social media platforms that allow us to share or
      like a specific post with an online friend. However, in music streaming
      platforms where users are allowed to create playlists, follow playlists,
      or follow band/artists, there exists a fundamental issue. Although there
      are methods to find online tickets to your favorite concert, you may
      consider whether you should go with a friend. However, what if your
      friends do not enjoy the same music as you? What can you do? You may get
      discouraged from going to the concert because you donâ€™t have a friend to
      go with.</p>
      <br>
    <p> This was the main issue that our team hoped to address. By focusing on
      this aspect, our team could potentially design something that encourages
      concert goers to find new friends and ultimately enjoy upcoming music
      events together. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="projectTabText">
    <h2>Need-Finding and Research</h2>
    <p> In order to begin the design process, we needed to understand our
      target audience. In order to do so, we conducted interviews and
      sent out surveys. Both research methods included questions that gave
      participants the opportunity to explain their personal experiences or
      current frustations with finding friends to go to concerts with.
      Our questions included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How do you find music events currently?</li>
      <li>Do you go to music events with your friends? If so, how often?</li>
      <li>How do you currently share music with others?</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p> After conducting our research, we found two important findings:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Spotify users do not want to attend concerts alone
          and would much rather go with people they know.</li>
      <li>The majority of Spotify users find concerts through friends.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="projectTabText">
    <h2>Paper Prototypes</h2>
    <p> In order to visualize our application, we began to build paper
        prototypes. We created two different paper prototypes that are shown
        below. We also tested both of our prototypes and gained
        constructive feedback from three users.</p>

    one of the participants.</p>

  <div class="projectTabText">
    <br>
    <h3>Prototype A</h3>
    <p>After testing out Prototype A, we noticed that users said that it was
    very easy to navigate through the app and preferred it over Prototype B
    since it was easier to create a group and to search for concerts. However,
    they also mentioned that some aspects could be improved. For example, the
    sizing of the buttons were too small for them to use, so they proposed
    making the buttons slightly more visible. One user also said that having a
    voting feature was redundant since their goal was focused on inviting
    other members into the group and not voting on specific times to meet.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Prototype B</h3>
    <p>While testing Prototype B, many users were left in confusion. Many
      were unable to navigate through the app mainly because there were too
      many buttons on each screen leaving users overwhelmed. More specifically,
      one user noted that on the "Song Info" screen, they weren't sure what the dots
      (in the right corner) referred to and questioned its purpose. Lastly,
      users got stuck at the group creation process since they were unfamiliar
      with its features.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="projectTabText">
    <h2>High Fidelity Prototype</h2>
    <p>After testing our paper prototypes, we decided to focus on prototype A,
      since users were more comfortable in navigating through this design. We
      also took aspects that users enjoyed from prototype B such as the
      "Invitations" screen. By taking this feedback into account, we created
      our Hi-Fi prototype. We removed some features such as the voting feature
      since it deterred users from our actual goal. We also split the group
      creation process into two completely different screens so that users could
      easily detect that they are creating a group. Once we were
      done designing our Hi-Fi prototype, we conducted another round of user
      testing.</p>

    <h2>Final Design</h2>
    <p>When comparing our final design to our initial prototype, you are able
    to visualize which features we changed and how those changes further
    developed our extended feature. </p>
    <img src="images/projects/spotify/finaldesign.png" width="100%">
  </div>

  <div class="projectTabText">
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>After working on this project, I felt that this experience definitely
      helped me learn how to work as a team and increased my skills in designing
      user interfaces. Throughout this 10 week process, our team
      designated roles and expected each team member to communicate with one
      another to make sure that we were meeting deadlines. By working as a team,
      each member gave their critiques
      on each design and insured that each feature had intentionality. Another
      skill that I learned while working on this project was being able to take
      constructive criticism from users to fulfill their needs. This definitely
      geared our team to create an optimal design for our users. </p>
      <br>
    <p>One challenge that our team faced while creating this extended feature
      was finding a way to present concert information during the group creation process.
      We didn't want users to feel overwhelmed with having too much information
      but we wanted them to have enough information to complete their goal of
      finding other users within the app. If I were to continue to work on this
      project, I would want to continue to research more about what kind of designs
      could help users interact with people that have similar music interests.</p>
