    <h2>Free Me</h2>
    <p>This project is about an app called Free Me. It is currently being prototyped and designed by me and some other group members.
    In this project we propose to create an app that builds a safe environment for students that suffer mental
    illnesses such as depression or anxiety. By focusing on this goal, we created several types of scenerios that would help
    benefit them. By creating the app, we propose to give them tools and resources to maintain a healthy lifestyle and a chance
    to talk to a personal advisor. In our design, we thought it would be best if we had a personal advisor for each user since
    it would create chances to interact one on one and it would also inhibit their depression or anxiety. So far,
    we have discussed the demographics of the app, prepared some storyboards, and are continuing to build prototypes for our app.
    Here is a small glimpse of what we are currently designing.
  </p>

  <p> Before we started designing prototypes, we started to sketch out logos.
    These are the sketches that we came up with. For our app logo, we intended to
    fully represent the app that we were designing. So we wanted to represent the act of not having to
    worry about mental illness by having a free mind. After sketching the logos, we decided to shift
    our focus on what type of demographics or personas we should build. These personas are characters
    that exemplify which type of group our app intended to help. The following are the created personas.
  </p>

    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <img src="images/projects/freeme/Persona_2.jpg">
    </div>
  </div>

  <p> Similar to the personas, the storyboards help depict the different types of problems
    that we have to take into consideration while designing our app. While trying to figure out the design, we
    discussed the possibilities of creating a chatbot that diagnoses each patient. However, we also thought about
    having our app to include an online community where each user is anonymous. After testing, we have
    made some changes of within the design.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p> After storyboarding, we moved on to build rough sketches and protoypes for our app.
    We learned from our storyboards what kind of specific target audience we wanted for our app.
    With this at hand, we began building lo-fi prototypes. These are the following potential sketches
    that had generic idea of what our app would look like.

  </div>

  <p> Currently, we are still designing what kind of features our app should have. After building
    lo-fi prototypes, we were able to test these lo-fi prototypes out with people and received
    some critique and feedback. We are currently taking this feedback and implementing a better app design
    that will generate a better workflow for our users.
